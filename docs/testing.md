# Testing

[![Main](https://github.com/neurocracy/omnipedia/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/neurocracy/omnipedia/actions/workflows/main.yml)

Like most Drupal projects, we use [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) to run our
tests. See [the Drupal core automated testing
guide](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/automated-testing) and [API
documentation](https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core!core.api.php/group/testing)
for more details.

Our tests are found in the various custom modules listed in
[Overview](overview.md), though a few may later be added in this root repository
if appropriate for testing Omnipedia as a whole.
