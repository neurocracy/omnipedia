# Testing

Like most Drupal projects, we use [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) to run our
tests. See [the Drupal core automated testing
guide](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/automated-testing) and [API
documentation](https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core!core.api.php/group/testing)
for more details.
